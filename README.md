file sharing with c++
<h2>Simple C++ <i>(also unplanned and buggy and people don't want these types of things)</i> File sharing Software</h2>
<h3>Sadly only works in windows</h3>
<h4>Created using winsock2 </h4>
<h1>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</h1>
<h2>To do</h2>
<ol>
<li>
  proper response from send file for completion
</li>

  need to fix for using std::bind for using it with std::async
<li>
 <li>
   check if newly added port is already there 
 </li>
 <li>
   add recive option
 </li>
</ol>
<h2>MISTAKES YOU SHOULD NEVER DO</h2>

</ul>
